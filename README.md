# Installing macOS on an Chromebook

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### ‚ö†Ô∏è READ THIS!!!
**This guide was made for an ASUS C425 (LEONA).** Your mileage **will** vary for any other devices, but as long as it's **not a Pentium or Celeron, it is possible.** If you have a Celeron or a Pentium Chromebook, it will **NOT** work. **Please do your own research before proceeding if you do not own an C425 as this guide may provide conflicting information.** If you have any questions, please ask away in the Issues tab.

### Got macOS installed on another device?

First off, congrats! Second, if you want to be featured in this guide, you may create a PR / Issue so I can add it in. At the minimum, your documentation should include what works and what doesn't, your specs, the steps you took that weren't mentioned in the Dortania guide, and the SMBIOS you found that worked the best for you. You can use my documentation as an reference.

#### With that said, we can move on.

Turns out, this laptop works quite well with macOS. For more information about the Chromebook's hardware, refer to [here](https://github.com/meghan06/ChromebookOSX/blob/main/Hardware.txt).

### Requirements

**üî∏ For all supported Chromebooks except Step 2.**

Before you start, you'll need to have the following items to complete the process:

- A external storage device (can range from a SD card to a USB Disk / Drive) for creating the installer USB.  
- The latest OpenCore version (**at least 0.8.8**) for eMMC boot drive support.   
- An internet connection.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **An understanding that this process has the potential to damage / brick your device, potentially causing it to become forever inoperable.**


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Known Issues

**üî∏ C425 Specific**

- ~~Random freezing in Safari tabs (mostly video playback tabs like YouTube)~~ - See **possible** fix below.
  - Disable `Optimized video streaming while on battery` and it'll fix it.
- Random render issues on Discord and Spotify.
  - To fix this, diable GPU acceleration in settings and it'll fix it.
- Render issues after sleep on Spotify and Discord, potentially other apps too. (Need help)  
  - Temporary fix is to restart after sleep.
- ~~Weird lock ups randomly.~~
  - Fixed.
- **Report other issues in [Issues](https://github.com/meghan06/ChromebookOSX/issues)**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**The instructions outlined in this document have the potential to cause permanent harm to your laptop, and you should be aware of this potential outcome before proceeding. I cannot be held accountable for any damage resulting from following or disregarding these instructions and make no promises regarding the reliability or efficiency of the software contained in this repository.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installation

Here are the steps to go from chromeOS to macOS via OpenCore on your Chromebook. 

**üî∏ For all supported Chromebooks.** 

## **The following steps are **requried** for proper functioning.**
1. If you haven't already, flash your Chromebook with [MrChromebox's UEFI firmware](https://mrchromebox.tech) via his scripts. To complete this process, you must turn off write protection either by using a SuzyQable cable or temporarily removing the battery (latter is less cumbersome).

2. Setup your EFI folder using the [OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). Use Kaby Lake Laptop for your `config.plist`.
    
3. *Do switch VoodoolPS2 with this [custom build](https://github.com/one8three/VoodooPS2-Chromebook/releases) for keyboard backlight control + custom       remaps 
   - Keyboard backlight SSDT can be found [here](https://github.com/one8three/VoodooPS2-Chromebook/blob/master/SSDT-KBBL.aml). 
      - This SSDT **ONLY** works with the custom VoodoolPS2 version linked in Step 3.

4. Download corpnewt's¬†SSDTTime, open it, select the first option `FixHPET`, choose `C` for default, and drag the SSDT it makes (`SSDT-HPET`) into your `ACPI` folder. Then, in the same folder, copy the patches from `oc_patches.plist` into your config.plist under `ACPI -> Patch`. Without it, eMMC won't be recognized by macOS. (This is an bug with EmeraldSDHC.)
   
   Notice for Step 4: This **might** have been fixed in an new update, just haven't tested it yet. Try booting without the `IRQ` patches above first, and if your eMMC drive doesn't show up in Disk Utility, you'll have to add these patches. If it still doesn't show up, you either messed up one of the steps above or your eMMC drive is not supported (yet).


5. Install macOS and enjoy!

Note: More information about `ProtectMemoryReigons` can be found [here](https://dortania.github.io/docs/latest/Configuration.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Things not mentioned in the Dortania guide that you **need** to do:

**üî∏ This section is mixed. Step 2 and 4 are C425 only.**

   - **you will regret it later if you don't** 
   1. Use Laptop Kaby Lake for your config.plist 
   2. ***In your `config.plist`, under `Booter -> Quirks` set `ProtectMemoryReigons` to `TRUE` if you want working shutdown/restart/WiFi. You MUST change this. It is `FALSE` by DEFAULT.**
   
   3. In your `boot-args`, add `watchdog=0` and `-igfxnotelemetryload` for iGPU acceleration. 
   4. Despite what the guide says, your SMBIOS should be `MacBookAir8,1`. 
   - If you choose to use `MacBook10,1`, you will NOT have Low Battery Mode.

### macOS Ventura
#### Only for those who want to update to macOS Ventura. 
**üî∏This section is C425 specific. Do your research before proceeding if you are using a different device.**

Before we get started, you should know the following:
- **Your battery will drain faster on Ventura.** To avoid this, stay on Monterey or older.
- Intel WiFi works, but is a little iffy during startup. It'll take a few seconds (`~20s`) after login for it to connect.
- If you want to install Ventura, you need to install macOS 12 (Monterey) first, then update from System Preferences as AirportItlwm does not work with the C425's WiFi card at the moment.

With that, l3ts get started!

### Preparations
Note: these steps can be done after updating, you just won't have WiFi. It is reccomended to follow the steps below **before** updating for the least amount of pain and suffering.

1. Mount your EFI using corpnewt's MountEFI.
2. Under OC/Kexts, delete your old itlwm/AirportItlwm kext and replace it with `itlwm v.2.2.0 alpha`
3. Download and install Heliport if you haven't already. The most recent stable release will work fine.
4. Launch ProperTree and reload (`ctrl+r`) your `config.plist`. 
5. Start the update. (If you haven't already)

You are now ready for macOS Ventura! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Misc. Information

üî∏ For: **All supported Chromebooks**

- *When formatting the eMMC drive in Disk Utility, make sure to toggle "Show all Drives" and **erase the WHOLE drive**, not just the current partition.
- Format the drive as `APFS`
- Map your USB ports prior to installing macOS for a painless install. You **will** reget it if you don't. You can use [USBToolBox](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool) to do that.
- `itlwm` is more stable & faster than `AirportItlwm`
- You might have some text render and DRM issues, there's no fix for this. :(
- Control keyboard backlight with left `ctrl` + left `alt` and `<` `>`. 
    - `<` to decrease, `>` to increase.
- To fix the battery life on Ventura, you can set Low Battery Mode to be always enabled on battery. It's not perfect, but it helps.
- eMMC will come up as an external drive in the boot picker since eMMC is just a embedded SD card. Nothing you can do about it.
- To hide the drive picker, set `ShowPicker` to `False` in `Misc` ->` Boot` -> `ShowPicker`
- `AppleXcpmCfgLock` and `DisableIOMapper` can be enabled or disabled. Makes no difference.
  
 #### *Note: The hotkey to show drives **DOES NOT WORK**. Make a copy of your EFI with `ShowPicker` enabled if you need to boot from another drive.
